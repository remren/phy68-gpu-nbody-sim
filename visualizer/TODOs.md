TODOs:
- [DONE] Fix nbody-block-mod so that it saves .w, the mass of the body, within the file
- [DONE] Fix the particle loader so it also accounts for mass of bodies in a seperate list
- [DONE] Incorporate mass of body into the visualizer as a color or size change
- [DONE] Find an interesting simulation to visualize for the final project

Would be nice:
- come up with a better file storage system. this is abhorrent
